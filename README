README for Object-Capsule

An Object::Capsule is a thin, permeable membrane that fits nicely around an
object.  Method calls are passed on to the object, which functions normally
inside the capsule.  The object can be retrieved by dereferencing the capsule
as a scalar.

My intent is to use an object capsule subclass to allow the inflation of
multiple object types from a single column in Class::DBI.
